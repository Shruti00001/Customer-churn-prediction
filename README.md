# 📈 Customer Churn Prediction
### 💡 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a full-cycle data analysis and visualization workflow. I began by creating a realistic, synthetic sales dataset using Python. I then analyzed this data to uncover key performance insights and built a dynamic dashboard using Power BI to present my findings.

### 🚀 The Business Problem
Businesses need to go beyond raw sales numbers to understand what drives performance. This project aims to provide clear, actionable insights into sales trends, product performance, and regional growth to help a company make data-driven decisions.

### 🛠️ The Process
1.  **Data Generation**: Used **Python** (`pandas`, `numpy`) to create a synthetic sales dataset with realistic data points for revenue, growth rate, and product information.
2.  **Data Analysis**: Cleaned and explored the dataset to find trends and key performance indicators (KPIs).
3.  **Dashboard Development**: Built a comprehensive and interactive dashboard using **Power BI**.

### 📊 Dashboard Features & Key Insights
* **Revenue at a Glance**: Track total revenue and growth over time.
* **Product Performance**: Identify top-selling products and regions.
* **[Add Your Own Insight]**: A key finding from your analysis. For example, "Found that Product C showed the most consistent growth in the East region."
