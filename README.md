# 📈 Customer Churn Prediction

### 💡 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a full-cycle data analysis workflow. I began by creating a realistic, synthetic sales dataset from scratch using Python. This project highlights my ability to generate, structure, and prepare data for further analysis.

### 🚀 The Business Problem
Data is the foundation of any business insight. This project addresses the challenge of creating a clean, structured dataset from the ground up, providing a reliable source for sales trend analysis and performance tracking.

---

### 🛠️ Methodology
The entire project was built using Python. The key steps were:
1.  **Data Generation**: Used **Python** libraries like `pandas` and `numpy` to programmatically create a synthetic dataset with realistic variables like regions, products, revenue, and growth rates.
2.  **Data Structuring**: The script saves the generated data into a clean, ready-to-use CSV file, demonstrating skills in data formatting and preparation.

### 📊 Key Insights
Since there is no Power BI dashboard, you should include a brief summary of the key insights from your analysis here. If you used your Python script to analyze the data, list the findings.
