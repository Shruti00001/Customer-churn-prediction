📦 Customer Churn Prediction

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn using synthetic data. It simulates a telecom business scenario where identifying at-risk customers can help improve retention and reduce revenue loss.

 🔍 Key Features
-Synthetic Dataset: Generated realistic customer data including tenure, monthly charges, contract type, internet service, support calls, and payment method.
- Modeling Techniques: Built and compared Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers using accuracy, ROC AUC, and classification metrics.
- Interpretability: Identified top churn drivers using logistic regression coefficients and decision tree feature importances.
- Visualization: Plotted ROC curves to evaluate model performance and visualize trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn for modeling, evaluation, and preprocessing

 📈 Business Relevance
Customer churn prediction is vital for subscription-based businesses. By understanding churn drivers, companies can:
- Personalize retention strategies  
- Reduce customer acquisition costs  
- Improve long-term profitability

This project is designed to be modular and extensible, making it easy to adapt for real-world datasets or integrate with advanced techniques like SHAP, hyperparameter tuning, or ensemble models.
